# Multi-Regression-Model
The multiple regression model is an extension of the simple linear regression model that allows for the analysis of multiple independent variables in relation to a single dependent variable. 
the multiple regression model can be used to understand how several factors simultaneously influence a performance metric or outcome associated with software development projects.
The multiple regression model aims to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data points. The equation takes the form:

Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₚXₚ + ɛ

where Y represents the dependent variable, β₀ represents the intercept (the value of Y when all independent variables are zero), β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ represent the coefficients associated with each independent variable X₁, X₂, ..., Xₚ, and ɛ represents the error term.
The multiple regression model estimates the coefficients (β) by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. These coefficients provide information on the direction and strength of the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship, negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship, and larger coefficients imply a stronger influence on the dependent variable.
